# Create-honeypot-token

My name is Stuart Jarrett, I am a smart contracts developer, Solidity programmer and just a blockchain enthusiast since 2018.

In the attachment to this repository you can find smart contract codes for honeypot tokens. With these smart contracts you can deploy your token on blockchains such as Ethereum, BSC and Base.
